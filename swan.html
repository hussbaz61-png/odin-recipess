  <h1>Tchaikovsky's influences</h1>
  <p style="color: #5C6F2B;">From the late 1700s to the 1890s, ballet music was usually written by specialists who created light, and rhythmically clear works. Before starting Swan Lake, Tchaikovsky studied the style of composers such as Cesare Pugni and Ludwig Minkus. He especially took inspiration from Léo Delibes, Adolphe Adam, and Riccardo Drigo, mentioning them in letters to his protégé Sergei Taneyev. When writing Swan Lake, Tchaikovsky reused themes from earlier works. His nephew and niece said he had written a small ballet called The Lake of the Swans in 1871, which already contained the “Swan’s Theme.” He also borrowed music from his abandoned opera The Voyevoda and from his unfinished opera Undina. By April 1876, the score was finished and rehearsals began. Choreographer Julius Reisinger rejected some parts as hard to dance to and used other composers’ music instead. Tchaikovsky objected, and his music was restored.</p> <hr>
    
  <h1>Composition process</h1>
    <p style="color: #5C6F2B;">Tchaikovsky’s enthusiasm for Swan Lake is reflected in the speed of its composition. Commissioned in the spring of 1875, the score was completed within a year. In letters to Sergei Taneyev dated August 1875, he explained that his haste was driven not only by excitement for the project but also by a desire to complete it quickly, thereby freeing himself to begin work on an opera. He first composed the scores for the opening three numbers, before undertaking the orchestration in the autumn and winter, and continued to wrestle with the instrumentation well into the spring. By April 1876 the work was finished. His reference to an early draft implies the existence of a preliminary outline, though no such document has ever been found. In correspondence with friends he spoke of his long‑standing wish to write for the ballet stage, describing this particular commission as both stimulating and laborious in equal measure.</p>
